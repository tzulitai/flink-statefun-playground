# Apache Flink Stateful Functions Playground (v3.0 series)

This repository contains tutorials and examples for Stateful Functions, for the version 3.0 series. The material here is a great starting point if you've just started with getting to know the project or looking for specific examples of common usage patterns.

## Where should I start looking?

The tutorials and examples are separated into a few different categories that each have their own top-level directory.

- For SDK language specific tutorials, head to their corresponding directories, such as `java/` and `python/`. These directories contains the basics of using the various StateFun SDKs to start writing your first StateFun applications. For new users, these are great places to start!
- To check out examples for deploying StateFun applications, head to `deployments/`. Here you'll find deployment examples on various systems, such as Kubernetes or FaaS platforms on varios cloud providers.

Each tutorial or example will have it's own `README` that explains in detail what is being covered and how to build and run the code by yourself.

Other directories that are not mentioned above, such as `playground-internal/`, is intended for tooling used in the code and can be safely ignored by users.
